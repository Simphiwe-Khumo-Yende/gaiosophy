# App Store Connect API Authentication Issue - SOLVED Private Key ✅

## ✅ **Great Progress Made:**
- ✅ Private key format is now working (6 lines of *** in debug)
- ✅ All secrets are properly loaded
- ✅ No more decoder errors

## ❌ **Current Issue: API Authentication**
```
"code": "NOT_AUTHORIZED"
"title": "Authentication credentials are missing or invalid."
```

## 🔧 **Solutions to Try:**

### Option 1: Verify API Key Permissions
1. Go to [App Store Connect API Keys](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api)
2. Find your API key with ID: `Y7639KMBXG`
3. Check that it has these permissions:
   - ✅ **Developer** or **App Manager** role
   - ✅ **Access to provisioning profiles**
   - ✅ **Not expired**

### Option 2: Check Team ID
The API key must belong to the same team as your bundle ID `com.gaiosophy.app`.

1. Go to [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
2. Note your **Team ID** 
3. Verify this matches the team that created the API key

### Option 3: Generate New API Key (Recommended)
If the current key has issues, create a new one:

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api)
2. Click **"Generate API Key"**
3. Settings:
   - **Name**: `GitHub Actions iOS Deploy`
   - **Access**: **App Manager** (gives full access)
   - **Download**: Save the `.p8` file
4. Note the new **Key ID** and **Issuer ID**
5. Update GitHub secrets with new values

### Option 4: Alternative - Manual Build
If API issues persist, we can modify the workflow to:
1. ✅ Build the iOS app successfully 
2. ✅ Generate IPA file
3. ✅ Download as artifact
4. 🚀 Upload manually to TestFlight

## 🎯 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Workflow infrastructure**: Perfect
- ✅ **Flutter build**: Ready to work
- ✅ **Secret handling**: Fixed
- ❌ **API credentials**: Need verification/new key

## 🚀 **Quick Test Option:**
Want to see the iOS build work right now? I can modify the workflow to skip the provisioning profile step and just build the app. This will prove everything else works!
