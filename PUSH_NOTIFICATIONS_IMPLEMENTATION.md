# Push Notifications Implementation Summary

## âœ… Complete Setup

Push notifications are now fully configured to work when new content is added to the Gaiosophy app.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Firebase Cloud Functions (`functions/src/index.ts`)

Four Cloud Functions that automatically trigger when content is created:

- **`notifyOnContentCreate`** - Monitors `content/{contentId}` collection
- **`notifyOnPlantAllyCreate`** - Monitors `content_plant_allies/{contentId}` collection
- **`notifyOnRecipeCreate`** - Monitors `content_recipes/{contentId}` collection
- **`notifyOnSeasonalWisdomCreate`** - Monitors `content_seasonal_wisdom/{contentId}` collection

Each function:
- Checks if content `status === "published"`
- Extracts title and summary
- Sends FCM notification to the `new-content` topic
- Includes content metadata in the payload

### 2. Client-Side Notification Handling

#### Existing Components (Already Working)
- âœ… `PushNotificationService` - Handles FCM setup, token management, topic subscription
- âœ… Topic subscription to `new-content` when users enable notifications
- âœ… Foreground notification display using `flutter_local_notifications`
- âœ… Background/terminated app notification handling
- âœ… Token refresh and persistence

#### New Components (Added Today)
- âœ… `NotificationNavigationHandler` - Handles notification taps and navigation
- âœ… `NotificationNavigationWrapper` - Integrates handler into app lifecycle
- âœ… Navigation to content detail screen when notification is tapped
- âœ… Fallback to home screen if content ID is missing

### 3. Real-Time Content Monitoring

The app already monitors Firestore collections in real-time:
- `RealTimeContentByTypeNotifier` streams updates from Firestore
- Automatically displays new content when added
- Filters by season and status
- Works seamlessly with push notifications

## How It Works

### Content Creation Flow

```
1. Admin adds content to Firestore
   â†“
2. Cloud Function detects onCreate event
   â†“
3. Function checks status === "published"
   â†“
4. Function sends FCM notification to "new-content" topic
   â†“
5. All subscribed devices receive notification
   â†“
6. App displays notification (foreground or system tray)
   â†“
7. User taps notification
   â†“
8. App navigates to content detail screen
```

### Real-Time Content Flow

```
1. Admin adds content to Firestore
   â†“
2. Firestore triggers snapshot update
   â†“
3. RealTimeContentByTypeNotifier receives update
   â†“
4. UI automatically refreshes with new content
   â†“
5. No manual refresh needed
```

## Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Firebase CLI installed: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- Firebase project with Firestore and FCM enabled

### Deploy Cloud Functions

```powershell
# Navigate to project root
cd C:\gaiosophy_project\gaiosophy-app

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Navigate to functions directory
cd functions

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Deploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Verify Deployment

1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Functions
2. Verify all 4 functions are deployed and active
3. Add test content in Firestore with `status: "published"`
4. Check function logs: `firebase functions:log`
5. Verify notification received on test device

## Testing

### Test Push Notifications

1. **Enable notifications in app:**
   - Sign in to app
   - Go to Settings â†’ Notifications
   - Toggle "Content Updates" on
   - Grant system permissions when prompted

2. **Add test content:**
   ```json
   // In Firebase Console â†’ Firestore
   collection: content_plant_allies
   {
     "title": "Test Notification",
     "summary": "This is a test push notification",
     "status": "published",
     "season_id": "your-season-id",
     "updated_at": [Firestore Timestamp - now]
   }
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   - Notification appears on device
   - Tapping notification opens content detail screen
   - Content appears in app's real-time feed

### Test Notification Navigation

1. **Background tap:** Put app in background, receive notification, tap it
2. **Foreground tap:** Keep app open, notification appears, tap banner
3. **Terminated tap:** Force close app, receive notification, tap it
4. All scenarios should navigate to content detail screen

## Configuration Files

### Created
- `functions/package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `functions/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `functions/src/index.ts` - Cloud Functions code
- `functions/.gitignore` - Ignore node_modules and build artifacts
- `lib/utils/notification_navigation_handler.dart` - Navigation logic

### Modified
- `lib/main.dart` - Added `NotificationNavigationWrapper`

### Documentation
- `CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed deployment guide
- `PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

## Architecture

### Topic-Based Notifications
- All users subscribe to `new-content` topic
- Functions send to topic (not individual tokens)
- Scalable: works with any number of users
- Efficient: one message sent, many devices receive

### Content Collections Monitored
- `content` - Main content collection
- `content_plant_allies` - Plant ally specific content
- `content_recipes` - Recipe specific content
- `content_seasonal_wisdom` - Seasonal wisdom specific content

### Notification Payload Structure

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "New Plant Ally: Bramble",
    "body": "Traditional autumn harvest plant with healing properties"
  },
  "data": {
    "contentId": "abc123",
    "contentType": "Plant Ally",
    "title": "Bramble",
    "seasonName": "Autumn",
    "clickAction": "FLUTTER_NOTIFICATION_CLICK"
  },
  "topic": "new-content"
}
```

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Function Logs
```powershell
# View all function logs
firebase functions:log

# View specific function logs
firebase functions:log --only notifyOnPlantAllyCreate

# Follow logs in real-time
firebase functions:log --tail
```

### Client Logs
- Check debug console for `PushNotificationService` logs
- Look for "ðŸ“± Notification tapped" messages
- Verify navigation success messages

### Firebase Console
- **Functions:** View execution count, errors, logs
- **Cloud Messaging:** Send test messages manually
- **Firestore:** Verify `users/{uid}/notificationTokens` array

## Troubleshooting

### No Notification Received
1. Check user enabled notifications in app settings
2. Verify device subscribed to `new-content` topic
3. Check `users/{uid}/notificationsEnabled === true` in Firestore
4. Verify content has `status: "published"`
5. Check function logs for errors

### Notification Received But No Navigation
1. Verify `contentId` in notification payload
2. Check router configuration in `app_router.dart`
3. Look for navigation errors in console
4. Verify `NotificationNavigationWrapper` is in widget tree

### Function Not Triggering
1. Verify function deployed successfully
2. Check Firestore collection name matches exactly
3. Verify function has permissions to send FCM messages
4. Check Firebase project has FCM enabled

### iOS Not Receiving
1. Upload APNs key in Firebase Console
2. Verify push capability enabled in Xcode
3. Regenerate provisioning profile
4. Test with physical device (not simulator)

### Android Not Receiving
1. Verify `google-services.json` is up to date
2. Check app signed with correct key
3. Test with physical device
4. Verify FCM enabled in Firebase project

## Cost Considerations

Firebase Cloud Functions pricing (Blaze plan):
- **Invocations:** $0.40 per million
- **GB-seconds:** $0.0000025 per GB-second
- **CPU-seconds:** $0.00001 per CPU-second

**Typical usage:**
- 10 new content items per day = 300/month
- Each function executes in ~100ms
- **Cost:** Free tier covers this easily

Free tier limits:
- 125,000 invocations/month
- 40,000 GB-seconds/month
- 40,000 CPU-seconds/month

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Notification on content updates (not just onCreate)
- [ ] Rich notifications with images
- [ ] Notification preferences (per content type)
- [ ] Scheduled notifications for specific times
- [ ] A/B testing notification copy
- [ ] Analytics: track notification open rates
- [ ] Web push notifications (currently mobile only)
- [ ] Notification history in app
