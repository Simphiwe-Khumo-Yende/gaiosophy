# ðŸ”” Push Notifications - Complete Implementation

## Summary

Push notifications are now **fully configured** and will automatically trigger when new content is added to any Firestore collection. The implementation includes:

âœ… **Firebase Cloud Functions** - Auto-send notifications when content is created  
âœ… **Client-Side Handling** - Display and navigate from notifications  
âœ… **Real-Time Integration** - Content appears instantly in app  
âœ… **Navigation Support** - Tap notifications to view content

## What Happens When Content Is Added

1. **Admin adds content** to Firestore (via Firebase Console or CMS)
2. **Cloud Function triggers** automatically within seconds
3. **FCM notification sent** to all users subscribed to "new-content" topic
4. **User sees notification** on their device
5. **User taps notification** â†’ App opens to content detail screen
6. **Content also appears** in app's feed automatically (real-time Firestore)

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Cloud Functions

```powershell
cd functions
npm install
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions
```

See `CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed steps.

### 2. Test Notifications

1. Enable notifications in the app (Settings â†’ Notifications)
2. Add test content in Firebase Console with `status: "published"`
3. Verify notification appears on your device
4. Tap notification and verify it opens the content

### 3. Go Live

Once tested, any content added with `status: "published"` will automatically trigger notifications to all users who have notifications enabled.

## Requirements for Notifications to Send

âœ… Content must have `status: "published"`  
âœ… Cloud Functions must be deployed  
âœ… User must have notifications enabled in app  
âœ… Device must be subscribed to `new-content` topic

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy Cloud Functions
- [ ] Enable notifications in app
- [ ] Add test content with `status: "published"`
- [ ] Verify notification received
- [ ] Tap notification and verify navigation
- [ ] Check function logs for errors
- [ ] Test on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Test when app is: open, background, closed

## Monitoring

### View Function Logs
```powershell
firebase functions:log
```

### Check Notification Status
- Firebase Console â†’ Cloud Messaging
- View sent message statistics
- Check for errors

### Debug Client-Side
- Check Flutter debug console
- Look for `PushNotificationService` logs
- Verify navigation messages

## Cost

**Free tier covers typical usage:**
- 125,000 function invocations/month (free)
- Typical: 10 new content items/day = 300/month
- Well within free limits âœ…
