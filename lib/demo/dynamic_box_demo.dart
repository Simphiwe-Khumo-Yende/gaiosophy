[morning] <u>Seasonal Rites</u>

<u>Samhain</u>

During Samhain, include crab apple in a 'dumb supper' under darkness to commune with ancestors. Trace a pentagram with an apple wood wand whilst speaking the names of the dead to invite them to join you.  Eat in silence and reverence as you remember the ancestors who paved the way for you.

<u>Ethical Foraging Practices</u>
<u>Ask Permission:</u>

Before harvesting, pause and greet the spirit of the tree. Listen for a response in your body. The old ones say: if the branch bows or a fruit falls freely, the tree is saying yes.

<u>Leave Offerings:</u>
A strand of hair, a whispered song, or a small stone from your pocket. Offer something of yourself to honour the ancient reciprocity between human and tree.

<u>Harvest Sustainably:</u>
Gather gently. Take only what is ripe and needed. Leave plenty for birds, bees, and the tree's future.

<u>Avoid Contamination:</u>
Forage away from roadsides, sprayed fields, and polluted sites. Apples are absorbers of what's in the soil and air.
