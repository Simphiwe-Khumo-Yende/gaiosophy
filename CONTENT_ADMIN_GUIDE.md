## Icon System

### What Are Icons?
Icons are small visual symbols that appear inline with your text to enhance readability and visual appeal. They help users quickly identify key concepts.

### How to Use Icons
Wrap icon keywords in square brackets `[keyword]` within your content.

**Basic Example:**
```
The [herb] chamomile grows best in [morning] sunlight and requires [water] daily.
```

**Result:** The üåø chamomile grows best in üåÖ sunlight and requires üíß daily.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Icons Not Displaying
- **Check spelling** - Icons are case-sensitive: use `[herb]` not `[Herb]`
- **Verify icon exists** - Refer to the icon list above
- **Check brackets** - Must be square brackets `[icon]` not parentheses or other brackets

#### Box Sections Not Working
- **Verify tags match** - Every `[box-start]` must have a matching `[box-end]`
- **Check style names** - Use exact style names: `[box-start:warning]` not `[box-start:warn]`
- **Line breaks matter** - Put box tags on their own lines when possible

#### Content Not Formatting Correctly
- **Test incrementally** - Add icons and boxes gradually to identify issues
- **Check for typos** - Extra characters can break formatting
- **Review examples** - Compare your content to working examples above

### Testing Your Content
1. **Preview in app** - Always test your content in the actual app
2. **Check all devices** - Verify appearance on different screen sizes
3. **Read aloud** - Ensure content flows naturally with icons
4. **Get feedback** - Have others review your enhanced content

### Style Guidelines
- **Be consistent** - Use the same style approach throughout your content
- **Stay relevant** - Choose icons that truly relate to your content
- **Consider context** - Warning boxes for safety, recipe boxes for preparations
