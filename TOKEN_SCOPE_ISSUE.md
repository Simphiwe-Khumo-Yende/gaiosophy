# GitHub Token Workflow Scope Issue

## Problem
Your current GitHub Personal Access Token doesn't have the `workflow` scope, which is required to create or update GitHub Actions workflow files.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update Your GitHub Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Find your current token or create a new one
3. Make sure these scopes are selected:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - ✅ `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)
   - ✅ `read:org` (Read org and team membership, read org projects)

4. Generate the token and update your git remote:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://Simphiwe-Khumo-Yende:NEW_TOKEN_WITH_WORKFLOW_SCOPE@github.com/Simphiwe-Khumo-Yende/gaiosophy.git
```

### Option 2: Create Workflow via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Simphiwe-Khumo-Yende/gaiosophy
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click "New workflow"
4. Choose "set up a workflow yourself"
5. Copy the content from `.github/workflows/ios-deploy.yml` (created locally)
6. Commit directly to GitHub

### Option 3: Use GitHub CLI
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI and authenticate
gh auth login
# Then push normally
git push origin main
```

## Current Status
- ✅ All TestFlight preparation files committed locally
- ✅ Bundle ID updated to com.gaiosophy.app
- ✅ Version bumped to 1.0.0+1
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created
- ❌ Workflow needs to be pushed to GitHub (token scope issue)

## What's in the Workflow
The GitHub Actions workflow I created will:
- 🏗️ Build iOS app on macOS runner (free 2000 minutes/month)
- 🔐 Handle code signing automatically
- 📱 Upload directly to TestFlight
- 🔄 Trigger on every push to main branch
- 🖱️ Allow manual triggers from GitHub web interface

## Next Steps
1. Update your GitHub token with `workflow` scope
2. Update the git remote URL with the new token
3. Push the workflow: `git push origin main`
4. Configure the required secrets in GitHub repository settings
5. Enjoy automated iOS deployments from Windows! 🎉

The workflow file is ready and waiting to be pushed!
